# Focus

_A-Muse-D presents: **Focus**_

Focus is a game aimed to help you focus on what matters. By using the [Muse](http://choosemuse.com) headband
as a companion, focus the more you can to make the squares (and worries) disappear.

## How to start

1. Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/Muse-2018/Amuzed`
2. Import the project on Android Studio
3. Enjoy!

## Caveats

- The Muse SDK used by the application only supports devices with ARM EABI V7a devices. This means that the Muse headset functionality only works on devices from about 2012-2014. Devices include:
    - Nexus 4
    - Samsung Galaxy S4
    - Nexus 7 (2012, 2013)
